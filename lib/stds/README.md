C - Standards is the continuation of the Standards game library, originally written in Java. While not all features are implemented such as handlers, the basic necessities for creating a game are completely here. All data structures for entity-handling/updating/drawing should be drawn by the programmer, but these structures should come at a future date. SDL is the back-end graphical library for this engine.

## Dependencies

The only dependencies for this library are SDL components.

1. [SDL_2.0.12](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
2. [SDL_ttf 2.0.15 (Fonts)](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
3. [SDL_mixer 2.0.4 (Audio)](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
4. [SDL_image 2.0.5 (PNG/JPG Wrapper)](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)

## Rebuilding C - Standards

To rebuild the code, clone the repository to your computer. This project is compiled with MinGW and a makefile. Depending on how you want to compile the project, you will need to alter the makefile to fit your needs and make sure you have SDL and its extensions installed correctly.
